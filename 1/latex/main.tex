		\part*{Setup}
		The system consists in a mass $m$ supported by a spring of stiffness $k$ and a viscous damper of unknown damping $c$. \par
		We assume that the system has only one degree of freedom $x$ and we know that
		\begin{align*}
			m & = \unit{\num{4.484}}{\kilogram} \\
			k & = \unit{\num{10500}}{\newton\per\meter}
		\end{align*}
	}
	\part*{Computations}
	\section{Natural frequency}
	The natural (or undamped) frequency\footnote{In this document, by convenience, angular frequency is shortened to frequency, despite their different units of measurement.} $w_0$ of the system, which would have been the frequency of the motion if the system wasn't damped, is given by
	\begin{align*}
		\omega_0 & = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \\
			& = \unit{\num{48.3907}}{\rad\per\second}
	\end{align*}
	\setcounter{section}{2}
	\section{Time response}
	\begin{figure}[h]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{resources/pdf/time_response.pdf}
		\caption{Acceleration response of the system from time $\unit{\num{0.140}}{\second}$ to $\unit{\num{9.850}}{\second}$.}
	\end{figure}
	First of all, we observe that our system performs damped harmonic oscillations. It means that $\varepsilon$, the damping ratio of the system, is strictely between $0$ and $1$. \par
	Further, to compute experimental system parameters, we have to select the 1\up{st} and the $n$\up{th} \footnote{In the matlab implementation, we have chosen $n = \num{50}$.} maxima of the dataset\footnote{We have shrunken the dataset to the time interval $\left[\num{0.140}, \, \num{9.850}\right] \, \left[\second\right]$ because extreme values were unreliable.} and interpolate around both peaks to obtain more accurate values of time and acceleration :
	\begin{align*}
		t_1 & = \unit{\num{0.1621}}{\second} & a_1 & = \unit{\num{8.793e-2}}{g} \\
		t_n & = \unit{\num{6.3645}}{\second} & a_n & = \unit{\num{0.299e-2}}{g}
	\end{align*}
	\subsection{Frequency}
	The frequency $f$ of an harmonic motion is the ratio between the number of full oscillations performed by the system during a time period and that time period length.
	\begin{alignat*}{2}
		                      &  & f_d      & = \frac{n}{t_n - t_1}                               \\
		                      &  &          & = \unit{\num{7.9001}}{\hertz}                       \\
		\Leftrightarrow \quad &  & \omega_d & = 2 \pi f_d = \unit{\num{49.6380}}{\rad\per\second}
	\end{alignat*}
	We see that the experimental frequency $\omega_d$ is a bit larger than the undamped frequency $\omega_0$, altought it should be smaller or equal given that
	\begin{align*}
		\omega_d & = \omega_0 \sqrt{1 - \varepsilon^2} \leq \omega_0
	\end{align*}
	It means that either our measures or our parameters ($m$ or $k$) are imprecise.
	\subsection{Logartihmic decrement}
	The logarithmic decrement $\Delta$ is defined by the neperian logarithm of the ratio between the amplitudes of two successive maxima. That ratio, and thus $\Delta$, is theoretically constant all along the harmonic motion. From its definition, it is easy to show that
	\begin{comment}
	\begin{align*}
		\Delta & = \ln \left(\frac{a_k}{a_{k+1}}\right)                                                                                         \\
		       & = \ln \left(\frac{1}{a_1} \frac{a_1}{a_{2}} \frac{a_2}{a_{3}} \cdots \frac{a_{k - 1}}{a_{k}} a_k \frac{a_{k}}{a_{k+1}} \right) \\
		       & = k \Delta + \ln \left(\frac{a_k}{a_1} \right)                                                                                 \\
		       & = \frac{ \ln \left(\frac{a_1}{a_k} \right) }{k - 1} \quad \forall k > 1
	\end{align*}
	\end{comment}
	\begin{equation*}
		\Delta = \ln \left(\frac{a_k}{a_{k+1}}\right) = \ldots = \frac{ \ln \left(\frac{a_1}{a_k} \right) }{k - 1} \quad \forall k > 1
	\end{equation*}
	Replacing with our computed values $a_1$ and $a_n$, we obtain
	\begin{align*}
		\Delta & = \frac{ \ln \left(\frac{a_1}{a_n} \right) }{n - 1} = \num{6.9002e-2}
	\end{align*}
	\subsection{Damping ratio}
	The value of the damping ratio $\varepsilon$ is usually computed according to its definition :
	\begin{align*}
		\varepsilon = \frac{c}{2 m \omega_0}
	\end{align*}
	In this case, the damping $c$ of the system is unknown. However, the damping ratio can still be estimated by the logarithmic decrement divided by $2 \pi$.
	\begin{align*}
		\varepsilon & \simeq \frac{\Delta}{2 \pi} = \num{1.0982e-2}
	\end{align*}
	\setcounter{section}{4}
	\section{Bode diagram}
	In the amplitude Bode diagram, we can observe a spike in amplitude near the natural frequency of the system. Searching for more accuracy, we can interpolate around the peak and obtain $X$, the maximum amplitude, and $\omega_b$, its associated frequency.
	\begin{align*}
		X & = \unit{\num{0.8116}}{g\per\newton} & \omega_b & = \unit{\num{49.7242}}{\radian\per\sec}
	\end{align*}
	\begin{figure}[h]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{resources/pdf/bode.pdf}
		\caption{Bode diagrams.}
	\end{figure}
	\subsection{Quality factor}
	The half-power method's first step is to find the frequencies $\omega_-$ and $\omega_+$ for which the amplitude is equal to $\frac{X}{\sqrt{2}}$. These can be found by interpolating separately each side of the amplitude Bode diagram's peak. In doing so, we obtain
	\begin{align*}
		\omega_- & = \unit{\num{48.9125}}{\radian\per\sec} & \omega_+ & = \unit{\num{50.1696}}{\radian\per\sec}
	\end{align*}
	We can now compute the quality factor $Q$ of the system
	\begin{align*}
		Q & = \frac{\omega_b}{\Delta \omega} = \frac{\omega_b}{\omega_+ - \omega_-} \\
		  & = \num{38.494}
	\end{align*}
	\subsection{Damping ratio}
	The damping ratio can be directly estimated from the quality factor.
	\begin{align*}
		\varepsilon & \simeq \frac{1}{2 Q} = \num{1.299e-2}
	\end{align*}
	\section{Nyquist diagram}
	\begin{figure}[h]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{resources/pdf/nyquist.pdf}
		\caption{Nyquist diagram.}
	\end{figure}
	\subsection{Quality factor}
	The quality factor can also be estimated by the amplitude\footnote{The amplitude has to be normed. In our case it means to multiply the amplitude by $m$.} at the phase resonance, described by a null real part. Firstly, we have to find the phase resonance frequency $\omega_n$ by interpolating around the real part root, which gives us
	\begin{align*}
		\omega_n = \unit{\num{49.4366}}{\radian\per\sec}
	\end{align*}
	It is now possible to determine the amplitude $X_n$ associated to $\omega_n$.
	\begin{align*}
		X_n & = \sqrt{\Re \left({\bm X}\right)^2 + \Im \left({\bm X}\right)^2} = \left|\Im \left({\bm X}\right)\right| \\
			& = \unit{\num{0.7723}}{g\per\newton} = \unit{\num{7.5759}}{m\per\second\squared\usk\newton} 
	\end{align*}
	And, therefore, the quality factor.
	\begin{align*}
		Q & \simeq m X_n = \num{33.9704}
	\end{align*}
	\subsection{Damping ratio}
	Finally, with the same estimation than before
	\begin{align*}
		\varepsilon & \simeq \frac{1}{2 Q} = \num{1.472e-2}
	\end{align*}
	\section{Conclusion}
	We can observe that either the time response, the Bode diagram or the Nyquist diagram gave us approximatively the same results :
	\begin{align*}
		\varepsilon & \approx 1 \%
	\end{align*}
	This shows that, as expected, all these methods are effective. Therefore, the choice between one or another should be lead by its convenience which varies from case to case.
